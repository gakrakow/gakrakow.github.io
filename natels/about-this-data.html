<h1>About Georgia Rare Natural Elements Conservation Data</h1>
<p><b>Data Limitations:</b> Before using our rare element location data please read the <a href="disclaimer.html">Disclaimer for Use of Rare Species Location Data</a>
<p><b>Rare natural elements:</b> Plant and animal populations, natural communities, bird nesting colonies, caves and other features in nature that are considered important for biodiversity conservation. Do not confuse the adjective, "rare", used here with the Georgia protection status "R - Listed as rare" (see <a href="#state-protection-status">Georgia Protection Status</a> below).</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/biotics-5">Biotics</a>:</b> A biodiversity conservation database developed and maintained by <a href="http://www.natureserve.org/" title="NatureServe Link">NatureServe, Arlington Virginia</a>, that is used by Georgia DNR to hold and interpret information about rare natural elements in Georgia. Biotics data is widely used by many private and public agencies.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/standards-methods/element-occurrence-data-standard"title="NatureServe Biotics Element Occurrence Data Standard">Element Occurrences (EOs)</a>:</b> Locations of rare natural elements that are monitored in the field and recorded in the Biotics database.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www1.usgs.gov/csas/swap/" title="State Wildlife Action Plans (SWAPs)">State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP)</a>:</b> A plan developed by each state for conserving wildlife and habitats before they become too rare or expensive to restore.

<p><b>Tracked Special Concern:</b> Rare natural elements with occurrence data (EOs) maintained in the Biotics conservation database. Contains protected and SWAP species, but also unprotected species, rare plant communities and other rare natural elements considered important for biodiversity conservation.</p>

<p><b>SWAP High Priority:</b> Species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) in Georgia’s SWAP. Contains both protected and unprotected species.</p>

<p><b>Georgia Protected:</b> Species with protection status under Georgia’s <a href="endangered-wildlife-act-of-1973.html">Endangered Wildlife Act</a> or <a href="wildflower-preservation-act-of-1973.html">Wildflower Preservation Act</a> which are implemented through the <a href="protection-of-speices-in-georgia.html">Protection of Endangered, Threatened, Rare, or Unusual Species Rules and Regulations</a>. Georgia’s protected species include U.S. protected species, because Georgia is required by federal law to protect federally protected species.</p>

<p><b>U.S. Protected:</b> Species protected by the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/">U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA)</a>.</p>

        vertebrate animal population, (e.g., listed under the U.S. Endangered
