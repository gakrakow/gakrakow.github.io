        subspecies of an otherwise widespread and common species would be G5T1.
        A T subrank cannot imply the subspecies or variety is more abundant
        than the species . For example, a G1T2 subrank should not occur. A
        vertebrate animal population, (e.g., listed under the U.S. Endangered
        Species Act or assigned candidate status) may be tracked as an
        infraspecific taxon and given a T-rank; in such cases a Q is used after
        the T-rank to denote the taxon's informal taxonomic status. </td>

<h2>SWAP Species of Greatest Conservation Need</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://teaming.com/state-wildlife-action-plans-swaps">State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP)</a> is developed for conserving wildlife and habitats before they become too rare or costly to restore. Each plan includes the identification of Species of Greatest Conservation Need for that state.
