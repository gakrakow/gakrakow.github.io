**Common Name:**   **FLATROCK ONION**

**Scientific Name:**  _Allium speculae_ Ownby &amp; Aase

**Other Commonly Used Names:**  Little River Canyon onion

**Previously Used Scientific Names:**  none

**Family:**  Liliaceae (lily) or Alliaceae (onion)

**Rarity Ranks:**  G2/S2

**State Legal Status:**  Threatened

**Federal Legal Status:**  none

**Federal Wetland Status:**  none

**Description:**  Perennial **herb** rising from a bulb; all parts of the plant have a distinct onion odor. **Leaves** usually 4 - 5 per plant, 8 - 10 inches (20 - 25 cm) long, fleshy, grass-like, flat or curved in cross-section with a long, deep groove running the length of the leaf. **Flower stalk** 8 - 12 inches (20 - 30 cm) tall, leafless, round in cross-section. **Flower cluster** with 10 - 15 flowers, the base of the cluster enclosed by a papery **sheath** that splits into 3 segments, each segment with a single, faint vein. **Flowers** about ½ inch (1.3 cm) across, with 6 spreading, white or pinkish **tepals** (3 petals + 3 sepals) and green centers. **Fruits** 3-lobed, rounded, with a series of low crests alternating with lobes.

**Similar Species:**  Cuthbert's onion (_Allium cuthbertii_) has 2 - 3 leaves per plant, 5 - 7 veins per sheath segment, down-curved tepals, and green, knobby crests on its fruits. Canada onion (_A. canadense_ var. _canadense_) produces a cluster of small bulbs with, or instead of, flowers. Mobile onion (_A. canadense_ var. _mobilense_) has 3 - 7 veins per sheath segment, and its fruits lack crests. False garlic (_Nothoscordum bivalve_) flowers have yellow centers; its stem is usually less than 1 foot (30 cm) tall, and its leaves lack the onion smell.

**Related Rare Species:**  None in Georgia.

**Habitat:**  In Georgia, seepy edges of vegetation mats on granite outcrops of Lithonia gneiss; in Alabama, shallow depressions on sandstone outcrops.

**Life History:**  Several types of insect are known to visit the flowers of flatrock onion, including honey bees, bumble bees, and butterflies. Seed dispersal occurs when the capsule opens; seeds fall to the ground and germinate near the parent plant, leading to a clumped growth pattern. The seeds of some western species of _Allium_ are dispersed when the inflorescence breaks off from the plant and is carried by the wind, but this has not yet been observed with flatrock onion.

**Survey Recommendations:**  Surveys are best conducted during flowering (mid-May–June) and fruiting (mid-June–mid-July).

**Range:**  Georgia and northeast Alabama (on Sand and Lookout Mountains, where it is known as Little River Canyon onion).

**Threats:**  Granite outcrops are threatened by quarrying, trash dumping, off-road vehicle use, and development.

**Georgia Conservation Status:**  Flatrock onion occurs at 8 outcrops, none of which is protected.

**Conservation and Management Recommendations:**  Protect granite outcrops from quarrying, trash dumping, and off-road vehicle use. Direct foot traffic away from rare plant sites. Create buffers and limit development around outcrops. Protect outcrops with conservation easements.
