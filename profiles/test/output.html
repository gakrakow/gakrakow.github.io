<p><strong>Common Name:</strong> <strong>GEORGIA ALDER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Alnus maritima</em> (Marshall) Muhlenberg ex Nuttall ssp. <em>georgiensis</em> Schrader &amp; Graves</p>
<p><strong>Other Commonly Used Names:</strong> seaside alder</p>
<p><strong>Previously Used Scientific Names:</strong> <em>Alnus metoporina</em> Furlow</p>
<p><strong>Family:</strong> Betulaceae (birch)</p>
<p><strong>Rarity Ranks:</strong> G3/S1</p>
<p><strong>State Legal Status:</strong> Threatened</p>
<p><strong>Federal Legal Status:</strong> none</p>
<p><strong>Federal Wetland Status:</strong> OBL</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> <strong>Shrub</strong> up to 33 feet (10 m) tall with a narrow crown and many, erect trunks with smooth bark. <strong>Twigs</strong> green and hairy when young, smooth and reddish-gray when older. <strong>Leaves</strong> 1¾ - 3½ inches long, ¾ - 2 inches wide (4.5 - 9 cm long, 2 - 5 cm wide), alternate, deciduous, with toothed edges, rounded or tapering bases, and 6 - 10 parallel veins on each side of the midvein; upper surface dark green and shiny; lower surface pale green with dark gland dots and yellowish hairs on the veins. <strong>Female flowers</strong> in small catkins, maturing in late summer to solitary, woody, oval <strong>fruiting cones</strong> about 1 inch (1.2 - 2.8 cm) long and ¾ inch (1.2 - 2.2 cm) wide, on stalks in the angle between leaf stalk and twig; cones last for a year or more. <strong>Male flowers</strong> tiny, in drooping clusters of elongated catkins. <strong>Female and male flowers</strong> occur on the same plant.</p>
<p><strong>Similar Species:</strong> Tag alder (<em>Alnus serrulata</em>) leaves are dark green on the lower surface and have 8 - 14 parallel veins on each side of the midvein. Fruiting cones are smaller, about ¾ inch (1 - 2.2 cm) long and ⅜ inch (0.6 - 1.2 cm) wide, in clusters of 3 - 5 cones with very short or no stalks. Tag alder flowers only in the spring.</p>
<p><strong>Related Rare Species:</strong> None in Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat:</strong> Sunny areas in ponds and spring-fed swamps.</p>
<p><strong>Life History:</strong> <em>Alnus maritima</em> occurs in 3 widely disjunct populations, with each population considered a separate subspecies. The populations on the Delmarva Peninsula of Delaware and Maryland are named after the seaside location of the first observed plants – ssp. <em>maritima</em>. The plants in Oklahoma and Georgia are also named for their locations – ssp. <em>oklahomensis</em> and ssp. <em>georgiensis</em>, respectively. Georgia’s plants occur more than 700 miles from both the Oklahoma and Delmarva Peninsula populations. Botanists believe that <em>Alnus maritima</em> was once widely distributed across North America and that changing environmental conditions eliminated the species from all but its 3 currently known locations. Once isolated from each other, the populations diverged genetically to a degree that warrants recognizing each disjunct group of plants as separate subspecies. Oklahoma plants have longer, narrower leaves and cones and a rounder growth form than either the Georgia or the Delmarva plants; Georgia plants have narrower leaves than the Delmarva plants as well as smaller, rounder cones and a taller, narrower growth form.</p>
<p><strong>Survey Recommendations:</strong> Plants flower and develop new cones in the late summer–fall. Leaves can be identified throughout the growing season and cones are present year-round.</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Northwestern Georgia, southeastern Oklahoma, and the Delmarva Peninsula of Delaware and Maryland.</p>
<p><strong>Threats:</strong> Disruption of natural hydrology in springs and spring runs. Shoreline clearing and development. Ditching, draining, and filling wetlands. Polluted runoff and siltation into ponds and springs from adjacent uplands.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Conservation Status:</strong> One population is known, it occurs on private land. This is the only population of Georgia alder known in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Conservation and Management Recommendations:</strong> Avoid ditching, draining, and otherwise</p>
<p>altering hydrology of ponds and spring-runs. Protect ponds and spring-runs from sedimentation and pollution. Protect shorelines from development.</p>
